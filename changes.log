***Changes on 20.05.2015:
- Created a working controller and model that receives thumbs up and down and stores them on the movie object in MongoDb.
- Update MoviesAsHtmlListWithDependencies.template so that it may post thumbs to this controller

***To be done:
- Make sure thumbs can only be changed up or down once per session.
- Amount of thumbs up or down must be shown in the view.
- Perhaps using socket.io
- Testing of new controller needs to be done and all test controllers need to be re-run
